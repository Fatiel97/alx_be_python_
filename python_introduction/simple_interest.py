# Define the variables
principal = 1000       # representing $1000
rate = 0.05                # representing 5% annual interest rate
time = 3                    # representing  3 years


# Calculate  the simple interest using the formula (I = P * R * T)
interest = principal * rate *  time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is : {interest}")
