# Define the variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculate the sum
Addition_result = number1 + number2

# Calculate the difference
Subtraction_result = number1 - number2

# Calculate the product
Multiplication_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {Addition_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {Subtraction_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {Multiplication_result}")
